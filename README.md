### Ones I have read and liked <a name="Read"></a>



### Ones I have write and I like <a name="Wrote"></a>
#### [Applifting-test](https://github.com/ridlees/Shopify2Hubspot) <a name="test_app"></a>
This was a test documentation to see, if I can be a techwriter. I spent around 3 hours and 15 minutes on it (this includes research, writing and creating requirements). The biggest challenge was to turn .md to .pdf. I have used three methods: (1) online tool to do so (which had issues with images), (2) GRIP (which made images to work, but destroyed anchors) and (3) pandoc (which made some mess with the anchors but images worked nicely)

_+_ I like how consistent it is, it was first .md file I am proud of. 

_-_ The GIFs did not work in PDF at all, changing .md to .pdf is tricky
## Learning sources <a name="Learning"></a>
This is my personal collection of resources I have learned from. Feel free to browse my personal notes :smirk:
### Books I have read <a name="books"></a>
As the title suggests, this section covers books I have read. If you can, toss a coin to the author, friend of techwriting. (But I understand if you can not)
#### Andrew Etter: Modern Technical Writing <a name="MTW"></a>
Short book which is like _gateway drug_ for techwriting: explaining the basics of techwriting, basic of markdown, restructured Text and Asciidocs (the difference between them) and talks about some principles. 

>__TAKE AWAYS__: Who do you write for?, Don't explain what API is in guide where you are integrating APIs, MD is good but it doesn't have many tools (like tables), so Asciidocs are sometimes the right tool. 

### Vidoes I have seen  <a name="videos"></a>
In this part, I keep notes on various online videos I have seen.
#### [Ellie Farrier: Wild Geeks: Poetry in the Digital Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBCRUTr2u0c ) <a name="Poetry"></a>

Interesting talk that emphatises how writing is _universal_ and how even poetry can help with documentations. This resonanted with me since I like to write haikus (just 17 syllables to create image) and this limited space is something that _just makes sense_ in case of docs.
>__TAKE AWAYS__: Think of form, think outside of the box, techwriters role is to share _knowledge_, poet shares _feeling_. 
#### [Kayla Lee: The Super Effective Writing Process of Grammy-winning Artists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxl3Ze7HIug)<a name="Grammy"></a>
Talk on sharebility of writing as process. At its root, Techwriting is _just_ writing and can hugely benefit from experiences of other writers. Their rituals, their tools to spark creativity or the way they do research, these skills can be shared with any _good_ techwriter.
